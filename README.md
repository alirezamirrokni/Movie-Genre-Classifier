# Movie Genre Classifier

Welcome to the Movie Genre Classifier project! This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify movies into various genres based on their plot summaries. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in genre prediction.

## Overview

The Movie Genre Classifier project includes the following components:

- **Data Collection**: The dataset used for training and testing the model. This includes movie plot summaries and their associated genres.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing the data for model training. This involves tokenization, lemmatization, and other text processing steps.
- **Feature Extraction**: Methods for transforming text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings are utilized.
- **Model Training**: Various machine learning algorithms are employed to train the genre classification model. This includes models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Scripts for evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Instructions and code for deploying the trained model to make predictions on new movie plot summaries.

## Features

- **Genre Classification**: Classify movie plots into predefined genres.
- **Accuracy**: Evaluate model performance with detailed metrics.
- **Customizable**: Easily update the dataset or model parameters to improve performance.
